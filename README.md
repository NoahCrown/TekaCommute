The application calculates a close estimate of the aforementioned transportation fee from one location to the next. It calculates the distance between the two locations as well.
It has express mode calculation which involves transport company like uber and grab. Meaning the fee will be much higher.

We have multiple variables assigned in one module that contains the distance of one locality from another. Then we multiply it by a multiplier to get the close estimate of the trasnport fee.
